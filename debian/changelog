tzc (2.6.15-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * We were depending on the version of com_err.h that was provided by
    Kerberos; but since we've removed that from the build-depends line, 
    this broke the on the autobuilders.  (Closes: #171856)

tzc (2.6.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

    since libzephyr3-krb will automatically pull in the kerberos libraries
    if necessary.  (Closes: #153783)
  * Removed ZckAuth.c hack since it adds a Kerberos dependency, and
    doesn't always work.
  * Apply patch from Karl Ramm to specify an opcode when sending a zgram.
